I started off by programming the enemy spawner script. This was achieved by roatating an object around a centre point and then having a two integers be incrimented. once one integer hits a value of 60 to count for a second it would randomly set the value of another integer and then reset the value of the first to 0 to repeat this process once every second. I then have it set so that if the second integer that is being incremented becomes greater than or equal to the value of the randomly set variable it would spawn an enemy and then slightly increase the speed of the objects rotation to help keep the timing and location of spawning random.
